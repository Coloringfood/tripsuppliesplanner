    <h1>Trip Supplies Packing List</h1>
    <p>
        This website is designed to help generate an appropriate packing list for any vacation you may go on. Normally
        you have to spend time trying to decide what you need to pack, and almost always forget to pack something
        important. Now with this, if you forget something once, you can add it to our list, and next time it will
        remember for you!
